# blue-bell-ai-infrastructure
Documentation of AI infrastructure I have built out for Blue Bell Creameries

I constructed an enterprise AI platform serving 1000+ employees at Blue Bell Creameries from scratch. I built and installed the on-premise GPU server, setup and managed the environment, and created the platform singlehandedly. 

## Stack
- vLLM inference server (currently running Qwen3-32B-AWQ, will be upgraded when more GPUs are installed)
- Dify workflow orchestration
- LDAP authentication
- On-prem GPU infrastructure

## Workflows
- Intelligent query routing across departments
- Live Oracle DB integration
- Vector knowledge base retrieval
- Multi-branch conditional logic

## Performance
- Sub-3s response times
- 32B parameter model on-prem
- Handles sales, ops, HR queries

Built and maintained completely solo.
